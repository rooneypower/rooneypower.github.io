WHO'S WHO &#13;
&#13;
RUTH ANDREWS (Diana Marsden) is delighted NOT to be playing the &#13;
dotty old lady again, after playing Gertie in Fuddy Meers in 2001 at SBCT &#13;
and Julia in Lend Me a Tenor in 2002. This is her second time on stage with Jim Coppens; their first was in The Lion in Winter in 1991. &#13;
&#13;
GARRETT BAUER (Production Designer) is one of SBCT's three Resident Scenic Designers. He has designed all of Civic's productions over the past four years at The Morris Performing Arts Center, and is already at work on Fiddler on the Roof. which runs the weekend of August 8-10 at The Morris. &#13;
&#13;
VINNY CHHIBBER (Corporal Mahavolitch) is an East Coast transplant, &#13;
who made his Firehouse debut in June as Officer Welch in SBCT's frenetic production of the Neil Simon farce Rumors. &#13;
&#13;
JIM COPPENS (Michael Riordan), who recently appeared in Rumors (with his good friend Vinny Chhibber), counts among his favorite roles those of Henry II in The Lion in Winter (with Ruth Andrews), Willie Clark in The Sunshine Boys and C.S. Lewis in Shadowlands (both with Fred Syburg), Harold Hill in The Music Man and James Tyrone in Long Day's Journey Into Night (both with Mary Ann Moran), and Harvey (with Jean Plumhoff). &#13;
&#13;
MARY ANN MORAN (Marian Raymond)has played lead roles in Civic productions of The Belle of Amherst, A Streetcar Named Desire, and Long Day's Journey into Night, among others. Vice-President of SBCT's board of directors, she also chairs the board's Play Selection Committee. &#13;
&#13;
CINDY MURRAY (Stage Manager) came to South Bend from Michigan City. Ind., to attend IUSB. This is her first production with Civic. As stage manager, she has drawn on her experience managing her husband Gary's office. She has enjoyed sharing this experience with her husband of 17 years. &#13;
&#13;
GARY MURRAY (Superintendent Jackman) is making his SBCT acting debut in this production. A native of South Bend, he participated in high school productions under the direction of James Lewis Casaday, college productions at IUSB, and he was a member of Presbyterian Players. &#13;
&#13;
JEAN PLUMHOFF (Juliet Riordan) was seen most recently at SBCT as mean old Sister Clarissa in Over the Tavern. She has been featured over several years at Civic in productions of I Hate Hamlet, Lettice &amp; Lovage, Harvey, Angel Street, The Philadelphia Story, Steel Magnolias, I Never Sang for My Father, and Les Belles Soeurs. Jean is a past president of South Bend Civic Theatre. &#13;
&#13;
JUDY SPIGLE (Director) has been seen (onstage) and unseen (backstage) at SBCT since 1986. Previous Civic directing credits include As You like It, 1959 Pink Thunderbird, The Cemetery Club, and The Children's Hour. She is the proud recipient of a 1998 SBCT Bucket Brigade Award for Seascape. &#13;
&#13;
FRED SYBURG (Harry Raymond) was last seen at SBCT as Candy in Of Mice &amp; Men. Previous credits at Civic include the role of Jacques in As You Like It, Les Kennkat in Boy Gets Girl, Gardner Church in Painting Churches, and Zaretzky in Conversations With My Father. He is scheduled to direct Moliere's Tartuffe next fall at the University of Notre Dame. He dedicates his performance to the memory of Sir Alec Guiness in gratitude for his inspiration.&#13;
&#13;
DIRECTOR'S NOTES: Go and The Stillborn Lover &#13;
A description of the game of Go by the American Go Association calls it "a beautiful art in which Black and White dance across the board in delicate balance." According to Steve G. Bailey, "...where chess is a battle, Go is guerilla warfare." &#13;
&#13;
Mindy McAdams explains that, "At first glance, the board may appear to be square, but it is not.... It is always slightly longer than it is wide, just enough to prevent perfect symmetry.... &#13;
&#13;
"The white stones invade a black-bordered area; the black stones creep in under the edge of a white-bordered area; and vice versa. Having jostled and poked and intruded, the stones at game's end touch one another's edges, illustrating the battles won and lost, forming a map of the contest of two minds." It is, ultimately, "in fact ... a series of discussions and arguments about the choice of moves." &#13;
&#13;
Go is simple and elegant in its play, yet so spatially complex that computer programmers have yet to design a program that consistently beats the best players. It is quiet and thoughtful. While its playing field fills, strategies unfold. At times only the most experienced players can envision who will emerge as the winner before the endgame is complete-and sometimes even they do not know until the points are counted. &#13;
&#13;
And so it is with Timothy Findley's The Stillborn Lover. </text>

WHO'S WHO &#13;
&#13;
DAVID CHUDZYNSKI (Production Designer) is an actor/director/production designer/playwright and children's theatre instructor at Civic. He directed Book of Days for SBCT last December; he will appear on stage in Civic's upcoming Studio Season production of Apartment 3A; and his newest play, Zebra Swallowtail, will be staged at The Firehouse in July.&#13;
&#13;
TERRY DAWSON (Stage Manager) appeared on stage at the Bendix last March in SBCT's production of Boy Gets Girl. He has also acted at The Firehouse in productions of The Diary of Anne Frank and As You Like It.&#13;
&#13;
TERRY FARREN (Director) is pleased to have a checkmark next to another classic he has always wanted to direct, and especially to have produced it in a three-quarter thrust similar to where he first learned his craft at Ohio University. A few of his favorites directed at SBCT include The Diary of Anne Frank (when he directed his daughter Audra), Glengarry Glen Ross, and especially the 2000 SBCT Production of the Year A Piece of My Heart. While in Los Angeles for ten years as a professional actor/director, he was casting director for several seasons at The Company of Angels, the city's oldest Equity Waiver theatre. He enjoys teaching the adult acting classes here at SBCT, while also assisting his wife Sara with the adult drama ministry at Clay United Methodist Church.&#13;
&#13;
DAVID HARTWIG (Curley), a 2001 ND graduate, is currently the company manager and executive director of Summer Shakespeare at Notre Dame. His numerous theatrical highlights include roles in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and Kennedy's Children and directing credits for The Water Engine, The Mikado, All in the Timing, Much Ado About Nothing, and Hamlet.&#13;
&#13;
DAN HILL (Carlson) is appearing for the first time on stage. He views it as a real learning experience, quite different from his daily routine as an attorney.&#13;
&#13;
DAN LEHNER (Lennie) is appearing in his fourth SBCT production. He was seen last year in Book of Days, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, and Alice in Wonderland. He would like to thank his family and friends for their support.&#13;
&#13;
MEGAN MICHELE (Curley's wife) is returning to theatre after a five-year absence. In the past she has been in musicals - Last Chance to Nowhere (Grandma), Grease (Sandy), Brigadoon (Fiona), Oklahoma! (chorus) - and many plays. She would like to thank God, first and foremost, for life, love, and happiness, all of which include her loving husband, Matt, and their beautiful baby boy, Evyn.&#13;
&#13;
RUSS NELSON (Slim) is glad to be back on stage after a year off! He was last seen at SBCT in An Enemy of the People and To Kill a Mockingbird. He looks forward to more acting and, possibly, directing. United we stand! Support our troops.&#13;
&#13;
SCOTT NELSON (Whit) is a graduate of Penn High School, where he studied improvisational acting and appeared in Dark Deeds at Swan's Place and Oklahoma! He then performed in the 1940s Radio Hour, The Servant of Two Masters, and Sleeping Beauty at North Park College in Chicago. His last appearance was with the Ft. Lauderdale Players in Hot L Baltimore. This is Scott's first play with Civic.&#13;
&#13;
TOM PETERSON (George) is a recent transplant from the Detroit area, which he still calls home and where he worked happily with several community theatres. Some of this favorite roles include Alan in Equus, Seymour in Little Shop of Horrors, Billy Bibbitt in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and John Merrick in The Elephant Man.&#13;
&#13;
JOHN RUSSELL (Ranch Hand) is working on his first SBCT production, following in the footsteps of two of his three sons who have already participated in shows at Civic.&#13;
&#13;
ROGER SENKBEIL (Boss) is a member of Civic's board of directors. He made his SBCT acting debut in 2001 as an SS Officer in The Diary of Anne Frank.&#13;
&#13;
DOUGLAS STREICH (Assistant Director) directed The Laramie Project for Civic last summer. Other SBCT directing credits include The Designated Mourner, Painting Churches, and The Essence of Banana. He is a past president and former board member of South Bend Civic Theatre.&#13;
&#13;
FREDERIC SYBURG (Candy) most recently appeared in Medea at St. Mary's College. At SBCT, he has been seen in Boy Gets Girl, Painting Churches, An Enemy of the People, and Conversations With My Father, among others. He is scheduled to direct Tartuffe at the University of Notre Dame next fall.&#13;
&#13;
ROD TODD (Crooks) has appeared in recent SBCT productions of An Enemy of the People, Wit, The Old Settler, Black Coffee, and A Lesson Before Dying.</text>

WHO'S WHO &#13;
Rhoda M. Bradshaw was seen last season at Civic in Leader of the Pack, Blessed Assurance, and The Laramie Project. As she has done for the past three years, she will once again be celebrating her birthday onstage at The Firehouse. Good show, great music, talented people ...what better present could you ask for? Oh, yeah, SOLD OUT HOUSES! &#13;
&#13;

Her most recent role there was as Ann Collier in The 1940s Radio Hour. Other musical credits include the part of Sally Bowles in Cabaret, Fanny Brice in Funny Girl, Reno Sweeney in Anything Goes, Dolly Levi in Hello, Dolly, and Miss Mona Stangley in The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas. Jenny wishes to thank her two sons, Vince and Nick, for their encouragement and support. &#13;

He has directed several shows for Civic since 1984, as well as being the Founder/Director/Vocalist of the local entertainment troupe The South Bend Junxion, now celebrating its 20th anniversary. "J.J." wishes to thank his talented cast, co-director Jeff, and especially musical director Elaine, for her patience. As always, he dedicates this show to this partner, Frank.&#13;

One of her favorite roles was that of Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady.&#13;
&#13;
Jeff A. Wilder, last seen on the Firehouse stage in the musical revue "Tony" in 1981, stepped into this production two weeks before opening when a former cast member was injured.

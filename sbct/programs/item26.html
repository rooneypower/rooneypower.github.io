            theatre instructor at Civic. He directed Book of Days for SBCT last December; he will
            appear on stage in Civic's upcoming Studio Season production of Apartment 3A; and
            his newest play, Zebra Swallowtail, will be staged at The Firehouse in July. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">TERRY DAWSON</span> (Stage Manager) appeared on stage at the Bendix last March in SBCT's production of

         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">TERRY FARREN</span> (Director) is pleased to have a checkmark next to another classic he has always wanted
            to direct, and especially to have produced it in a three-quarter thrust similar to
            where he first learned his craft at Ohio University. A few of his favorites directed
            at SBCT include The Diary of Anne Frank (when he directed his daughter Audra), Glengarry
            Glen Ross, and especially the 2000 SBCT Production of the Year A Piece of My Heart.
            While in Los Angeles for ten years as a professional actor/director, he was casting
            director for several seasons at The Company of Angels, the city's oldest Equity Waiver
            theatre. He enjoys teaching the adult acting classes here at SBCT, while also assisting
            his wife Sara with the adult drama ministry at Clay United Methodist Church.

         <p><span class="bioname">DAN HILL</span> (Carlson) is appearing for the first time on stage. He views it as a real learning

         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">SCOTT NELSON</span> (Whit) is a graduate of Penn High School, where he studied improvisational acting
            and appeared in Dark Deeds at Swan's Place and Oklahoma! He then performed in the
            1940s Radio Hour, The Servant of Two Masters, and Sleeping Beauty at North Park College
            in Chicago. His last appearance was with the Ft. Lauderdale Players in Hot L Baltimore.

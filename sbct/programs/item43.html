            as a High School senior. Occasionally he has glimpses of it, just as the lights on
            stage have almost faded out...that is if he called the cue on time. He has recently
            designed sound at SBCT for The Seafarer and Auntie Mame and is especially grateful
            for the opportunity to work for such a talented and gracious cast and crew.

            designing, and building the costumes for a show that is magical and historical. Camelot
            has been a joy to work on and the stylistic dress has been a welcome challenge. Jonnie
            has enjoyed working with director David Chudzynski and the talented cast &amp; crew. You
            have also seen Jannie's designs this season in Moon Over Buffalo and Hairsp ray.

         <p><span class="bioname">Audrey Raymond</span> (Chorus) is in her first role in a musical in more years than is appropriate to print
            (she's a 'young' lady after all). She is enjoying this opportunity to pretend to be
            a lady. If she doesn't suffer a fatal fall from stage during a raucous choral number,
            she may even give another show a go. Until then, outside the hallowed halls of SBCT,
            she can be found taking center stage at the local karaoke bar. 
         </p>

         <p><span class="bioname">Lois Veen</span> (Co-Costume Design &amp; Construction) is delighted to work with Jonnie Kilic on creating,
            designing, and building the costumes for a show that is magical and historical. Camelot
            has been a joy to work on and the stylistic dress has been a welcome challenge. Lois
            has enjoyed working with director David Chudzynski and the talented cast &amp; crew. You
            have also seen Lois' designs this season in The Seafarer and Hairspray.

         <h2>WHO'S WHO</h2>
         <p><span class="bioname">RICK AVARD</span> (Keyboards/Musical Director), is a part-time freelance pianist/keyboardist. In addition
            to being part of Rave On! (the Buddy Holly tribute show), he maintains a busy schedule
            playing with Billy McGuigan in his numerous activities all around the country. Rick
            has also ventured into record production, completing the production duties on Billy
            McGuigan's debut CD, Billy As Billy. In addition, he has spent time playing with Omaha­-based
            singer/songwriter Mark Irvin, appearing on Mark's three CDs. He also plays at many
            wedding ceremonies and is part of a worship team at Faith ­Westwood United Methodist
            Church in Omaha. Rick is an avid CD collector and lives in Omaha with his wife, Shannon,
            and daughters Katie and Allison. 
         </p>
         <p>Favorite Beatle: George Martin. I know, I know, but his contribution to their canon
            cannot be ignored. 
         </p>
         <p>Favorite Beatle Song: "Strawberry Fields Forever," for numerous reasons: namely, it's
            a great song; but, more importantly, George Martin's production on this song is nothing
            short of amazing. His combination of two different versions of the song is sheer genius.
            This is The Beatles at their creative peak. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">JAY HANSON</span> (Lead Guitar/Vocals) has been a Beatle fan since childhood, when he "borrowed" his
            sister's copy of the "Red Album" and his brother's copy of Abbey Road. (Holly and
            John, I promise to get those back to you soon ;^)) He is honored and thrilled to be
            a part of this celebration of Beatles music. Active in the music scene, Jay's "day"
            gig is as a recording engineer at Ware House Productions in Omaha. He dedicates this
            performance to the memory of his mother, Phyllis. "Thanks, Mom; the Beatles Bible
            has come in handy these last few months!" 
         </p>
         <p>Favorite Beatle: Paul. </p>
         <p>Favorite Beatles Song: The Anthology II version of "And Your Bird Can Sing." It's
            pretty hard to narrow it down to one favorite, but the version of this song on the
            Anthology captures John and Paul having a great time recording in the studio. Plus,
            it's hard to hear that song and not laugh along! 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">BILLY McGUIGAN</span> (Vocals/Guitar/Keys) is known to audiences around the U.S. as Buddy Holly. He has
            starred in some 380 performances of BUDDY: The Buddy Holly Story since originating
            the role in Omaha in 2002. Accolades include a Spotlight (Phoenix, AZ) Award for Best
            Actor in a Musical and a nomination for an Arizoni Award as Best Actor in a Musical,
            as well. Recently, the writers and producers of BUDDY chose Billy as their ''preferred
            Buddy Holly" in the United States. Billy also wrote and co-produced Rave On!, which
            has played all over the U.S., has been performed with symphonies, and is one of two
            "tribute" shows endorsed by the Buddy Holly estate. In July 2006, Billy released his
            much anticipated original music effort, Billy As Billy. A collection of songs written
            and demo-ed in post-Katrina New Orleans, Billy As Billy has received positive acclaim
            and reviews throughout the country. The complete list of "thank you's" for Yesterday
            and Today is too long to list here, but I'll throw out a few, anyway: Chip Greene,
            Bob Carlisle, Betsye Paragas, and Jim Othuse (for making sure this show happened),
            Beau Bisson, Eric Bricking, these incredible musicians on stage who I'm proud to call
            friends and family, The "Hollyheads," John Morrissey, Colleen Quinn, and the three
            most important people in my life-my beautiful wife Rachelle, incredible daughter Cartney,
            and baby boy Ciaran (I absolutely couldn't do this without you!). I would like to
            dedicate this show to my father, Bill McGuigan, who would have given anything to see
            his "boys" performing Beatles music on stage together. We hope you will enjoy the
            show! 
         </p>
         <p>Favorite Beatle: My daughter's namesake of course, Paul McCartney. </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">Favorite Beatles Song: Tough stuff here. "I've Got a Feeling" has always been one
               of my faves. It's the last real collaboration between John and Paul during a time
               when they were each writing their own stuff. It shows that the magic was sti11 there.
               "Drive My Car" is the song that's blowing my mind lately: great Lennon/McCartney lyric,
               great guitar work, and it just grooves. Of course, "Oh, Darling!" is my favorite to
               sing</span> (once a week, that is). Macca at his best. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">MATTHEW McGUIGAN</span> (Vocals/Bass) A man of few words, Matthew is excited to be performing Yesterday and
            Today. He is a graduate of PCCA in St. Petersburg, Florida, and has extensive theatrical
            credits, including: West Side Story (Tony), BUDDY· The Buddy Holly Story (Tommy),
            and Jesus Christ Superstar (Musical Director). When he's not performing with his brother
            Billy, he's the other half to the band Moses Prey. He's been playing music for fifteen
            years, and couldn't be any more excited to be a part of this production. He dedicates
            this performance to his wife, Christine, and to the memory of his late father, Bill.
            
         </p>
         <p>Favorite Beatle: John </p>
         <p>Favorite Beatles Song: "Happiness is a Warm Gun," because it has every angle of a
            great rock song; and, second, "A Day in a Life," because it's a masterpiece. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">DARREN PETTIT</span> (Saxophone/EWI/Harmonicas/Percussion/Keys/Vocals) received his bachelor's degree
            in saxophone performance from the University of Nebraska at Omaha, and his master's
            from the University of Cincinnati's Conservatory ofMusic. He is currently the saxophone
            instructor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, the director of the Metropolitan
            Area Youth Jazz Orchestra, and the co-founder of the Omaha Jazz Workshop. He also
            has a large studio of private students. Darren is in high demand as an active performer
            and educator in the Omaha area. 
         </p>
         <p>Favorite Beatle: George </p>
         <p>Favorite Beatles Song: Anything from the White Album; that record changed my life!
            
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">TOMM ROLAND</span> (Percussion/Vocals) holds a doctor of musical arts degree in percussion performance
            from SUNY Stony Brook. He has performed in a variety of musical settings throughout
            the U.S., Europe, India, and Japan. He was awarded a Fulbright grant to study the
            classical drumming of Southern India, where he studied mridangham and thavil with
            Sri T.H. Subashchandren and Sri K. Sekar. Tomm has been a featured artist/clinician
            at a variety of music events. His most recent recordings are Take Flight by the Omaha
            Symphony, Rave On: Live at the Drew, Billy McGui­gan's Billy As Billy, and Moses Prey's
            A Paper Moon. Tomm resides in Omaha, Nebraska, with his wife, Lesley, and sons Zachary
            and Dhani. 
         </p>
         <p>Favorite Beatle: The most "fab" of the Fab Four, the man who doesn't get the respect
            he deserves, and the one with the coolest nickname ever: Ringo. 
         </p>
         <p>Favorite Beatles Song: He has been listening to The Beatles since birth, a benefit
            of being born to California hippies during the Summer of Love. "Can't Buy Me Love"
            is the first song he remembers knowing how to sing as a child; and he knew the White
            Album backwards and forwards by the time he was seven years old.

         <h2>Who's Who</h2>
         <p><span class="bioname">DAVID CHUDZYNSKI </span>(Technical Director/Set &amp; Lighting Design) is the first full-time Technical Director
            in the history of SBCT. He is also well-known as an actor, director, theatre instructor,
            and playwright. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">KEVIN EGELSKY </span>(Moss) Kevin is ... "94% water." (Kevin was last seen in SBCT's production of American
            Buffalo as Donny.) 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">TERRY FARREN</span>( Director) Other directing credits at SBCT over the years include American Buffalo
            Of Mice and Men, The Diary of Anne Frank, A Piece of My Heart, and Night Breath. A
            theatre graduate of Ohio University, Terry worked in Los Angeles for ten years as
            a professional actor/director. He and his wife, Sara, an SBCT youth theatre instructor,
            are both active in the adult drama ministry at Clay United Methodist Church. Terry
            would like to state that he "never realized how rich and deep A Body of Water could
            be," and would like to thank "the entire flock for their dedication and love of Water."
            
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">MELISSA GARD </span>(Avis) states that she "feels amazingly comfortable in this new theatre nest." She
            would like to tell you more about her history, but...she just "doesn't remember."
            (A twenty-year Civic veteran, Melissa was last seen as Stella in Light Up the Sky.)
            
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">EMILY PICKERILL </span>(Wren) has discovered a "renewed appreciation for spar­ rows." She has enjoyed "stretching
            her wings" for the first time at SBCT. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">DOUGLAS STREICH </span>(Consultant Director) is pleased to be able to complete another tutorial in directing
            with Terry Farren. Doug, himself, recently directed SBCT's The Gin Game, which took
            first place honors at the Indiana Commu­nity Theatre League competition in March as
            well as second place at the re­gional competition for the American Association of
            Community Theatres in April. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">JODY THORLA </span>(Stage Manager) would like to thank the entire cast for the opportunity to work with
            three such talented individuals, and to Terry, "Let's Rock and Roll! and many thanks
            for including me." Jody also thanks SBCT for the "continued" opportunities to earn
            and keep his 2006 Volunteer of the Year Award. 
         </p>
         <p>ANNOUNCING THE FORMATION OF The South Bend Civic Wilson Society </p>
         <p>Following on the heels of one of the most ambitious building campaigns in the history
            of American community theatre, South Bend Civic Theatre is proud to announce the formation
            and the first members to join SBCT's Wilson Society, a select group of donors dedicated
            to securing with endowment gifts of $5,000 or more the theatre's health and prosperity
            for the next 50 years and beyond. As Civic's recent, historic building project neared
            its completion, the theatre's focus on endowment was greatly enhanced, when the Com­munity
            Foundation of St. Joseph County in September named SBCT winner of the 2007 Leighton
            Award for Nonprofit Excellence. This award, a high honor in itself, also carries with
            it a $100,000 Challenge Grant, which SBCT donors must match by De­cember 2007 in order
            to add $200,000 to Civic's endowment, held in perpetuity and administered by the Community
            Foundation as a per­manently protected and assured source of income for South Bend
            Civic Theatre in the future. Spurred by this challenge, Marjorie H. Wilson, wife of
            the late Dr. James M. Wilson, in both of whose names our new main auditorium was dedicated,
            generously offered to motivate prospective Civic do­nors even further by agreeing
            to match every gift of $5,000 or more that helped SBCT meet its Leighton Award challenge.
            In her honor, the theatre is proud to recognize those individuals who by their generosity
            have so far qualified for inclusion in Civic's Wil­son Society. They are: Alfred H.
            &amp; Martha J. Choitz Leslie J. Choitz Dick &amp; Chris Currey Tom &amp; Cathy Lower Alex &amp; Pam
            Regnery Barbara K. Warner

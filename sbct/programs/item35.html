         <h2>WHO'S WHO</h2>
         <p><span class="bioname">RICHARD ABBOTT</span> (Elyot Chase) completed his B.A. in Theatre from Indiana University at Bloomington
            and his M.F.A. in Acting from the University of South Carolina. Richard has worked
            extensively in television. industrials, voice over, live narration, and theatre. He
            has appeared previously in SBCT productions of Noises Off, All in the Timi1ng, and
            Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">KATHLEEN CANAVAN-MARTIN</span> (Louise) worked as a medical journalist for six years in Washington, D.C., before
            moving to the area in 1997. She received her MFA in creative writing from the University
            of Notre Dame, where she now serves as executive editor to the Notre Dame Review.
            She lives in South Bend with her husband and daughter. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">DAVID CHUDZYNSKI</span> (Technical Director) is the first full-time, salaried Techni- cal Director in the
            history of South Bend Civic Theatre. He has been the principal set designer for Civic's
            productions so far this year of Man of La Mancha, Noises Off, and, now, Private Lives
            in SBCT's new Wilson Main Stage Auditorium. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">MICHAEL COFFEE</span> (Victor Prynne) is delighted and excited to find himself in the new digs with a tremendously
            gifted cast and crew. Many thanks to Craig for the opportunity. But especially thank
            you to Terri, Abby, Lizzy, and Huck, who allowed him to participate, yet made it difficult
            to leave, all at the same time. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">CRAIG MAC NAB</span> (Director), a fifty-year theatre veteran, has appeared in SBCT productions of All
            in the Timing, The Underpants, The Little Foxes, and Noises Off. He also directed
            SBCT's 2006 production of Light Up the Sky. For Craig, mounting a production in the
            new Wilson Main Stage Auditorium, with a cast this gifted, is a profound treat. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">MICHELE MAC NAB</span> (Assistant Director/Stage Manager) is experiencing her first venture into the world
            of the theatre. It seemed strange at first; but, with her experience as a professional
            organizer and her attention to detail, she is beginning to feel right at home. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">MELANIE SOLNOKY</span> (Sibyl Chase) started her career on the stage with dancing and singing at age 6.
            She has starred in Grease, Zombies from the Beyond (as Mary Malone), and looks forward
            to many more at SBCT. After graduating from Purdue University in 2003, she moved to
            Indianapolis to further her career in business management. She joined 1st Source Bank
            in September of 2006 and is fluent in Spanish. She would like to thank her family
            and friends. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">ANN MARIE STEWART</span> (Amanda Prynne) made her SBCT debut in March in Noises Off. She holds a B.A. and
            an M.A. in Theatre and English from Michigan State University, and a PhD in Theatre
            History from the University of Colorado, where she performed with the Colorado Shakespeare
            Festival and the Dairy Center for the Arts. Most recently, she taught theatre at the
            University of Notre Dame, where she enjoyed directing students for the main stage
            season. She is currently publishing a book on female Restoration playwright Aphra
            Behn. 
         </p>
         <p>Update on SBCT's Wilson Society </p>
         <p>As Civic's recent, historic building project neared its completion, the theatre's
            focus on endowment was greatly enhanced when the Community Foundation of St. Joseph
            County last September named SBCT winner of the 2007 Leighton Award for Nonprofit Excellence.
            
         </p>
         <p>This award, a high honor in itself, also carried with it the prospect of a $100,000
            grant, to be made on condition that SBCT donors match that amount by December 2008
            in order to add $200,000 to Civic's endowment, held in perpetuity and administered
            by the Community Foundation as a permanent, assured source of income for South Bend
            Civic in the future. 
         </p>
         <p>The theatre is proud to recognize those individuals who by their generous contributions
            of $5,000 or more have helped SBCT to successfully meet its Leighton Challenge - nineteen
            months ahead of deadline! 
         </p>
         <p>They, along with all future donors of $5,000 or more to Civic's endowment, will be
            permanently listed as members of SBCT's Wilson Society, named for Marjorie H. &amp; James
            M. Wilson, after whom the theatre's new Main Audito­rium is named. They are: Gene
            &amp; Jane Bruce, Alfred H. &amp; Martha J. Choitz, Leslie J. Choitz, Dick &amp; Chris Currey,
            Tom &amp; Cathy Lower, Alex &amp; Pam Regnery, Barbara K. Warner, and Marjorie H. Wilson.

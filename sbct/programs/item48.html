         <h2>WHO'S WHO IN THE CAST &amp; CREATIVE TEAM</h2>
         <p><span class="bioname">Jewel Abram-Copenhaver</span> (Director) is honored to once again direct the Holiday Show. She has been celebrating
            the season and delighting SBCT audiences during this festive time of the year since
            2007. Jewel has been directing at SBCT and telling us stories since 1999 with some
            of her favorites being The Sound of Music, Alice in Wonderland and Huck Finn. She
            wants to thank her family, Mark, Tori and Brent, for their never ending support and
            love; this wonderful talented cast for all the laughter, care and joy through out
            the last two months; and always to lift an ever grateful heart to God for the many
            blessings in her life. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">Sarah Beudert</span> (Ilona Ritter) has performed with community theatres across the country--including
            Actors' Cabaret of Eugene OR; Village Light Opera Group, New York, NY; Barnswallow
            Theatre, just a few minutes away in Edwardsburg, MI; but is very excited to make her
            SBCT debut. She would like to thank her family and friends for their continued love
            and support. Go Team! 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">Roy Bronkema</span> (Ladislav Sipos) Roy is a veteran of several SBCT productions, including The Elephant
            Man, And Then There Were None, and Camelot. He most recently served as Music Director
            for the SBCT production of All Shook Up. Roy is an accomplished classical pianist
            and composer and he is grateful that his wife Nancy doesn't mind long evenings alone
            while he indulges this musical hobby! 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">Steve Chung</span> (Mr. Maraczek) debuted with SBCT in the summer of '99, playing the title role in
            Man of La Mancha, and has been a regular fixture in SBCT's musicals ever since, seen
            most recently as Herbie in Gypsy, Tateh in Ragtime, and as Pellinore in Camelot. He
            is hopeful that this production plays a joyful part in your holiday season. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">Terry Joe Dawson</span> (Window washer/Ensemble/Stage Manager Â­backstage) A retired teacher, Terry would
            first like to express his sincere gratitude to his loving wife, AnneMarie, for allowing
            him to come out and play with the SBCT where he has participated in over fifteen productions
            including To Kill A Mockingbird, Diary Of Anne Frank and Lend Me A Tenor. It is a
            true pleasure to be associated with the wonderful people in this production and this
            theatre. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">Zach Gassman</span> (Busboy/Ensemble) is making his first appearance on the mainstage of this theater,
            but he is no stranger to performance. He recently appeared in A Bad Year for Tomatoes
            at the Beckwith and is very proud of the many "Boo!'s" he received as Kevin in Superior
            Donuts in SBCT's Studio Theatre. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">Dominic Go</span> (Arpad Laszlo) is happy to be a part of this wonderful cast. You may remember him
            from Camelot, but you'd be mistaken because he wasn't in that. He has appeared in
            Civic Productions of Ragtime and Hairspray. Most recently, he finished the Round Barn
            Theater's production of Plain &amp; Fancy. He would like to thank his family and girlfriend
            for their continued support. And, finally, Merry Christmas to all, and you know the
            rest! 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">Pam Gunterman</span> (Choreographer) has appeared on the SBCT stage most recently as M'Lynn in Steel Magnolias,
            but is filling a new role in this production, that of choreographer (providing choreography
            for the restaurant scene). She wishes this great cast and directing team the very
            best with She Loves Me and is honored to have "played" a small part in this wonderful
            production. As always Pam is grateful to her husband Tony for his continued love and
            support and to God for life and its endless opportunities. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">Will Heckaman</span> (Steven Kodaly/Caroler) has been doing theater for nearly a decade. Most notably,
            he starred in Beauty and Beast, Lend Me a Tenor, and Arsenic and Old Lace. This is
            his eighth Civic Show and was most recently seen in Camelot. Thank you. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">Jill Hillman</span> (Ensemble) is excited to spend the Christmas season helping others get into the spirit
            -oflove, not shopping! She has most recently appeared onstage at the Kroc center as
            Mae Peterson in Bye Bye Birdie. She has appeared in the SBCT's productions of Camelot,
            Love Letters (with husband, James) Cabaret, Death of a Salesman, The Unexpected Guest
            and as Dolly Levi in Hello Dolly. She also appeared in The Main Stage, Inc productions
            of The Wedding Singer (Grandma Rosie), Sweeney Todd (Mrs. Lovitt) and All Shook Up
            (Sylvia). She proudly serves on the Board for SBCT. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">John Jung-Zimmerman</span> (Stage Manager - Booth/Sound Design) loves working behind the scenes at SBCT and
            marvels at all the talented cast and crew members that SBCT draws in. H e has recently
            designed sound for Wait Until Dark, and Stage Managed Superior Donuts, 39 Steps, and
            Seafarer. She Loves Me reminds him daily of the love his family show's him, especially
            grateful for that of his wife, Linda. With much gratitude, Merry Christmas! 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">Linda Jung-Zimmerman</span> (Assistant Director) has been involved with SBCT since she first brought her young
            daughter to an audition 11 years ago. Currently she is developing new skills as assistant
            director after spending many years as stage manager. One of the things she loves about
            SBCT is the opportunity to work with amazingly talented and fun people. It continues
            to be a great pleasure for her to work with two of her closest friends, her husband
            John and director Jewel. Linda and her husband are the recipients of the SBCT volunteer
            of the year award. She hopes you enjoy this Christmas gift! 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">Sean Leyes</span> (Georg Nowack) is thrilled to be returning to the SBCT stage for the 2nd time this
            year. He was last seen as Jack in Into the Woods and is thankful to have finally "grown
            up" into the character of Georg. He would like to thank his fellow cast and crew members
            for all of their hard work and special thanks to his family and friends for all their
            love and support. Merry Christmas! 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">Natalie MacRae</span> (Amalia Balash) Natalie is thrilled to be in SBCT's Christmas show once again. Most
            recently she appeared in SBCT's production of Into the Woods as Little Red Riding

            Grease (Cha-Cha), West Side Story (Graziella), and The Sound of Music (Liesl) to name
            a few. A special thanks to her family and friends for their never ending love and
            support. "I wouldn't have been able to balance it all without you!" Happy Holidays!
            
         </p>

         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">BJ Simpson</span> (Waiter/Caroler) "I'd like to thank God and the Lord Jesus Christ for eternal life.
            I appreciate my parents, Jay and Jill, for always supporting me. Everything I know
            about love, sacrifice, compassion, and endurance is exemplified by your lives. I love
            you forever. Perhaps you previously saw me being "delightfully disgusting and flirtatious"
            as The Sewer Man and Dr. Gaspard Jadin in 2012 SBCT's The Madwoman of Chaillot or
            throwing a Christmas party as Scrooge's nephew, Fred, in 2011 SBCT's A Christmas Carol:
            Scrooge and Marley. 2 Corinthians 5:17-6:2" 
         </p>

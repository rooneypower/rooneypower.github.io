         <h2>Who's Who in the Cast &amp; Creative Team</h2>
         <p><span class="bioname">KIRSTIN APKER</span> (Dan 1, Stage Manager) first played a member of the opposite sex in her third grade's
            radio play. However, her previous roles at Civic have all been "real women", including
            Elaine in Arsenic &amp; Old Lace (wannabe hussy), Fraulein Kost in Cabaret (certified
            hussy), vampire vixen in Dracula (bloodsucking hussy). She has also schlepped backstage
            for Moonlight &amp; Magnolias (bananas! peanuts!) and If You Give a Mouse a Cookie. Kirstin
            will soon add Ph.D. student to her collection of roles as she and her "real man" Tom
            invade the great swamp of D.C. "We will miss our SBCT family!" 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">LISA BLODGETT</span> (Dotty) is a 19-year old stay-at-home teen. She has been in the acting biz since
            she was 6 and hasn't stopped! She has been in 25 musicals and only 3 straight shows.
            This is her first comedy. She must admit that she feels a bit out of her element without
            a song, but likes to think Dottie sings in the shower. Lisa would like to thank two
            of her biggest cheerleaders, Mom &amp; Dad, &amp; "this amazing cast for their funny, wholesome,
            down-to-earth, homey aspects of their radiant splendiforousness!" 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">NICOLE BRINKMANN REEVES</span> (Zena) wants any ladies who are tempted to say, 'Nicole looks great!' to know that
            not only is beauty painful, it's expensive and time-consuming, and she thinks you
            would be better off putting your money and time toward developing other strengths,
            maybe kindness, math skills, a sense of humor? She also wants everyone to know that
            in real life she rarely wears makeup, has a Ph.D. in computational quantum chemistry,
            and married the man who told her that he thinks women look prettiest when they don't
            wear makeup. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">DAVID CHUDZYNSKI</span> (Set Designer) is SBCT's technical director, and designs sets for many of our productions.
            He is also a gifted actor, playwright and director. Director's Note: We knew David
            really 'got' this show when we came in for rehearsal to discover the zebra chairs
            &amp; leopard-spotted bookcase. LOL! 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">KYLE CURTIS</span> (Dan 2) has been in numerous shows with SBCT, Osceola Community Theatre and the Beckwith
            Theatre in Dowagiac He is nearing 4 years ofdoing theatre and the more experience
            he gets the more he falls in love with it. He is very happy and excited to be a citizen
            of Sterno. "Working on this show has been so fun &amp; all the people involved have been
            an absolute blast!" The biggest challenge has been trying to identify 5 different
            "people" in his head, oddly enough he found several women. He truly sympathizes with
            women now -"heels and bras are a hassle!" Special thanks to all his loyal friends
            &amp; family members who support his love for theatre. He hopes you have fun with the
            show! 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">JONNIE KILIC</span> (Costumes) Celebrating 20 years plus of volunteering, working and supporting SBCT,
            and not a gray hair! "It's all highlights. The opportunity to help visually create
            larger-than-life characters by finding/building unique costumes was appreciated. Thank
            you to Lois for her help in seeking and sewing. Costume items were found as far away
            as Lansing, MI and mid-Wisconsin. Thank you to the fine cast and crew for their fantastic
            costume finds." 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">SEYHAN KILIC</span> (Sound Design &amp; Execution) Crash, ding-dong, smack! "I am grateful to work with a
            most resplendent troupe, particularly Phil for assisting in discriminating some fine
            warbles. Also, special requites to my friend Don. I fancy tantalizing sonority and
            stupefying an apprised semblage." Editor's Note: The Rodale Synonym Finder was not
            harmed in the making of this bio. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">PHIL KWIECINSKI</span> (Hamel) most recently appeared in SBCT's It's a Wonderful life. You might have also
            seen him in The Arabian Nights, The Importance of Being Earnest, Over the Tavern,
            The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, or several different cameos over the years. "A big thank
            you to Neal at It's a Man's World for helping me look so damn good!" 
         </p>
         <p><span class="bioname">TAMI RAMAKER</span> (Director) is a playwright and actor as well as a director. She is the executive/
            artistic director at SBCT, and loves working fulltime in her field. "It is a real
            quirk of fate that I got the chance to direct this show, and it's kind of spooky ...
            The first show we did after I joined SBCT was Almost, Maine, which premiered at Portland
            Stage Company while I was there, and now, by accident, I get to direct another PSC
            premiered-show. It's been a great joy to work with such a talented cast and creative
            team - As a director, I will never say 'give me Ibsen or give me death' ever again!"

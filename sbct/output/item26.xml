         <entry>DAVID CHUDZYNSKI (Production Designer) is an actor/director/production designer/playwright and children's theatre instructor at Civic. He directed Book of Days for SBCT last December; he will appear on stage in Civic's upcoming Studio Season production of Apartment 3A; and his newest play, Zebra Swallowtail, will be staged at The Firehouse in July. </entry>
         <entry>TERRY DAWSON (Stage Manager) appeared on stage at the Bendix last March in SBCT's production of Boy Gets Girl. He has also acted at The Firehouse in productions of The Diary of Anne Frank and As You Like It. </entry>
         <entry>TERRY FARREN (Director) is pleased to have a checkmark next to another classic he has always wanted to direct, and especially to have produced it in a three-quarter thrust similar to where he first learned his craft at Ohio University. A few of his favorites directed at SBCT include The Diary of Anne Frank (when he directed his daughter Audra), Glengarry Glen Ross, and especially the 2000 SBCT Production of the Year A Piece of My Heart. While in Los Angeles for ten years as a professional actor/director, he was casting director for several seasons at The Company of Angels, the city's oldest Equity Waiver theatre. He enjoys teaching the adult acting classes here at SBCT, while also assisting his wife Sara with the adult drama ministry at Clay United Methodist Church. </entry>
         <entry>DAVID HARTWIG (Curley), a 2001 ND graduate, is currently the company manager and executive director of Summer Shakespeare at Notre Dame. His numerous theatrical highlights include roles in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and Kennedy's Children and directing credits for The Water Engine, The Mikado, All in the Timing, Much Ado About Nothing, and Hamlet. </entry>
         <entry>DAN HILL (Carlson) is appearing for the first time on stage. He views it as a real learning experience, quite different from his daily routine as an attorney. </entry>
         <entry>DAN LEHNER (Lennie) is appearing in his fourth SBCT production. He was seen last year in Book of Days, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, and Alice in Wonderland. He would like to thank his family and friends for their support. </entry>
         <entry>MEGAN MICHELE (Curley's wife) is returning to theatre after a five-year absence. In the past she has been in musicals - Last Chance to Nowhere (Grandma), Grease (Sandy), Brigadoon (Fiona), Oklahoma! (chorus) - and many plays. She would like to thank God, first and foremost, for life, love, and happiness, all of which include her loving husband, Matt, and their beautiful baby boy, Evyn. </entry>
         <entry>RUSS NELSON (Slim) is glad to be back on stage after a year off! He was last seen at SBCT in An Enemy of the People and To Kill a Mockingbird. He looks forward to more acting and, possibly, directing. United we stand! Support our troops. </entry>
         <entry>SCOTT NELSON (Whit) is a graduate of Penn High School, where he studied improvisational acting and appeared in Dark Deeds at Swan's Place and Oklahoma! He then performed in the 1940s Radio Hour, The Servant of Two Masters, and Sleeping Beauty at North Park College in Chicago. His last appearance was with the Ft. Lauderdale Players in Hot L Baltimore. This is Scott's first play with Civic. </entry>
         <entry>TOM PETERSON (George) is a recent transplant from the Detroit area, which he still calls home and where he worked happily with several community theatres. Some of this favorite roles include Alan in Equus, Seymour in Little Shop of Horrors, Billy Bibbitt in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and John Merrick in The Elephant Man. </entry>
         <entry>JOHN RUSSELL (Ranch Hand) is working on his first SBCT production, following in the footsteps of two of his three sons who have already participated in shows at Civic. </entry>
         <entry>ROGER SENKBEIL (Boss) is a member of Civic's board of directors. He made his SBCT acting debut in 2001 as an SS Officer in The Diary of Anne Frank. </entry>
         <entry>DOUGLAS STREICH (Assistant Director) directed The Laramie Project for Civic last summer. Other SBCT directing credits include The Designated Mourner, Painting Churches, and The Essence of Banana. He is a past president and former board member of South Bend Civic Theatre. </entry>
         <entry>FREDERIC SYBURG (Candy) most recently appeared in Medea at St. Mary's College. At SBCT, he has been seen in Boy Gets Girl, Painting Churches, An Enemy of the People, and Conversations With My Father, among others. He is scheduled to direct Tartuffe at the University of Notre Dame next fall. </entry>
         <entry>ROD TODD (Crooks) has appeared in recent SBCT productions of An Enemy of the People, Wit, The Old Settler, Black Coffee, and A Lesson Before Dying. </entry>

         <entry>JEAN PLUMHOFF (Juliet Riordan) was seen most recently at SBCT as mean old Sister Clarissa in Over the Tavern. She has been featured over several years at Civic in productions of I Hate Hamlet, Lettice &amp; Lovage, Harvey, Angel Street, The Philadelphia Story, Steel Magnolias, I Never Sang for My Father, and Les Belles Soeurs.

         <entry>DIRECTOR'S NOTES: Go and The Stillborn Lover A description of the game of Go by the American Go Association calls it "a beautiful art in which Black and White dance across the board in delicate balance." According to Steve G. Bailey, "...where chess is a battle, Go is guerilla warfare." </entry>
         <entry>Mindy McAdams explains that, "At first glance, the board may appear to be square, but it is not.... It is always slightly longer than it is wide, just enough to prevent perfect symmetry.... </entry>
         <entry>"The white stones invade a black-bordered area; the black stones creep in under the edge of a white-bordered area; and vice versa. Having jostled and poked and intruded, the stones at game's end touch one another's edges, illustrating the battles won and lost, forming a map of the contest of two minds." It is, ultimately, "in fact ... a series of discussions and arguments about the choice of moves." </entry>
         <entry>Go is simple and elegant in its play, yet so spatially complex that computer programmers have yet to design a program that consistently beats the best players. It is quiet and thoughtful. While its playing field fills, strategies unfold. At times only the most experienced players can envision who will emerge as the winner before the endgame is complete-and sometimes even they do not know until the points are counted. </entry>
         <entry>And so it is with Timothy Findley's The Stillborn Lover. </entry>

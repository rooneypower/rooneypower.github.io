                designerplaywright and children's theatre instructor at Civic. He directed Book of
                Days for SBCT last December; he will appear on stage in Civic's upcoming Studio
                Season production of Apartment 3A; and his newest play, Zebra Swallowtail, will be
                staged at The Firehouse in July.</entry>
            <entry>TERRY DAWSON (Stage Manager) appeared on stage at the Bendix last March in SBCT's
                production of Boy Gets Girl. He has also acted at The Firehouse in productions of
                The Diary of Anne Frank and As You Like It.</entry>
            <entry>TERRY FARREN (Director) is pleased to have a checkmark next to another classic he
                has always wanted to direct, and especially to have produced it in a three-quarter
                thrust similar to where he first learned his craft at Ohio University. A few of his
                favorites directed at SBCT include The Diary of Anne Frank (when he directed his
                daughter Audra), Glengarry Glen Ross, and especially the 2000 SBCT Production of the
                Year A Piece of My Heart. While in Los Angeles for ten years as a professional
                actordirector, he was casting director for several seasons at The Company of Angels,
                the city's oldest Equity Waiver theatre. He enjoys teaching the adult acting classes
                here at SBCT, while also assisting his wife Sara with the adult drama ministry at
                Clay United Methodist Church.</entry>

                Kennedy's Children and directing credits for The Water Engine, The Mikado, All in
                the Timing, Much Ado About Nothing, and Hamlet.</entry>
            <entry>DAN HILL (Carlson) is appearing for the first time on stage. He views it as a
                real learning experience, quite different from his daily routine as an
                attorney.</entry>
            <entry>DAN LEHNER (Lennie) is appearing in his fourth SBCT production. He was seen last

                (Sandy), Brigadoon (Fiona), Oklahoma! (chorus) - and many plays. She would like to
                thank God, first and foremost, for life, love, and happiness, all of which include
                her loving husband, Matt, and their beautiful baby boy, Evyn.</entry>
            <entry>RUSS NELSON (Slim) is glad to be back on stage after a year off! He was last seen
                at SBCT in An Enemy of the People and To Kill a Mockingbird. He looks forward to
                more acting and, possibly, directing. United we stand! Support our troops.</entry>
            <entry>SCOTT NELSON (Whit) is a graduate of Penn High School, where he studied
                improvisational acting and appeared in Dark Deeds at Swan's Place and Oklahoma! He
                then performed in the 1940s Radio Hour, The Servant of Two Masters, and Sleeping
                Beauty at North Park College in Chicago. His last appearance was with the Ft.
                Lauderdale Players in Hot L Baltimore. This is Scott's first play with
                Civic.</entry>
            <entry>TOM PETERSON (George) is a recent transplant from the Detroit area, which he
                still calls home and where he worked happily with several community theatres. Some
                of this favorite roles include Alan in Equus, Seymour in Little Shop of Horrors,

                Man.</entry>
            <entry>JOHN RUSSELL (Ranch Hand) is working on his first SBCT production, following in
                the footsteps of two of his three sons who have already participated in shows at
                Civic.</entry>
            <entry>ROGER SENKBEIL (Boss) is a member of Civic's board of directors. He made his SBCT
                acting debut in 2001 as an SS Officer in The Diary of Anne Frank.</entry>
            <entry>DOUGLAS STREICH (Assistant Director) directed The Laramie Project for Civic last
                summer. Other SBCT directing credits include The Designated Mourner, Painting
                Churches, and The Essence of Banana. He is a past president and former board member
                of South Bend Civic Theatre.</entry>
            <entry>FREDERIC SYBURG (Candy) most recently appeared in Medea at St. Mary's College. At
                SBCT, he has been seen in Boy Gets Girl, Painting Churches, An Enemy of the People,

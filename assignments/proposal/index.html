<h2>Content</h2>

<p><a href="https://sbct.org/about/" target="_blank">The South Bend Civic Theatre</a> (SBCT) is a community performing arts organization based in South Bend, Indiana. It has been showcasing local talent and entertaining the community with plays and musical performances since 1957. Last semester for Digital Libraries, I digitized a selection of old SBCT programs for display in an <a href="https://sbct.omeka.net/" target="_blank">Omeka collection</a>. While that site provides scanned PDFs and plain text generated via OCR, the text itself is not marked up nor displayed in an appealing web format. This project proposes to supplement that collection through the web publication of several of the programs in an original format and style.</p>

<h2>Audience and Significance</h2>

<p>The intended audience for this project is patrons and past performers of SBCT wishing to reminisce about shows gone by. It may also be of interest to scholars of the performing arts in the South Bend area. The audience aligns closely with the intended audience described in the current <a href="https://sbct.omeka.net/metadata/" target="_blank">collection scheme</a>, but this publication project adds the significant aesthetic benefit of an elegant and readable web format. The underlying marked up text will offer the opportunity for future republication in different styles and may facilitate data mining for research purposes.</p>

<h2>Technical Plan</h2>

<p>To execute this project, I will extract the content from Omeka, mark it up in a custom XML language, and then display it on the web as HTML. The extraction step will likely involve a mix of automation and manual effort. Omeka can output item metadata in one of several XML formats, which should enable copying via XSLT of key metadata fields. The program text itself is currently stored as plain text in a single metadata element for each program. It may require manual cleanup. The markup step will require manual effort, since the only existing structure in the program text is line breaks. Finally, I will create an XSLT stylesheet to convert the XML to HTML, supplemented by CSS.</p>

<p>My intention is to host the publication project on Github Pages and link each document to the corresponding Omeka item. This will free the digital publication project from the stylistic constraints of the free version of Omeka.net on which the collection is hosted, while simultaneously maintaining a connection to the source material.</p>
